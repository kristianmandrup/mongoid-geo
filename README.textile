h1. Mongoid geo

A Geo extension for Mongoid.

"MongoDB Geospatial Indexing":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing

* Supports Mongo DB 1.7+ sphere distance calculations
* Extra geo calculation methods such as #near_sphere etc.
* Add concept of a special "geo" field (for setting the location point)
* Calculate locations near a given point and return as criteria, sorted by distance

h2. Status update (May 18, 2011)

Created alias methods such as _#near_sphere_ for _#nearSphere_ etc. to make the DSL much more 'rubyish'!

h2. You need help?

Post questions in the "mongoid-geo":http://groups.google.com/group/mongoid-geo group. Here I (and other uses of mongoid-geo) will 
try to help out and answer any questions. 

h2. Suggestions, improvements and bugs?

Please raise issues or suggestions for improvements in the "Issues" section on github. 
I would recommend that you try to branch the project, try to fix it yourself and make a pull request. 

h2. Mongoid 2 geo features

The following summarized what geo functionality is already provided by Mongoid 2.0 (as far as I could tell, May 9th, 2011)

h3. Find addresses near a point

<pre>
  Address.near(:latlng => [37.761523, -122.423575, 1])
</pre>

h3. Find locations within a circle

<pre>
  base.where(:location.within => { "$center" => [ [ 50, -40 ], 1 ] })
</pre>

h3. Create geo-spatial index

<pre>
  class Person
    field :location, :type => Array
    index [[ :location, Mongo::GEO2D ]], :min => -180, :max => 180
  end

  # to ensure indexes are created, either:
  Mongoid.autocreate_indexes = true

  # or in the mongoid.yml
  autocreate_indexes: true
</pre>

These are the only geo features I could find that are currently built-in for Mongoid 2.

_Mongoid Geo_ implements some nice extra geo features:

h1. Mongoid Geo features

The following briefly demonstrates all the features that *mongoid-geo* provides:

h2. Geo index

A new _geo_index_ class method 

Usage example:

@geo_index :location@

Note: For embedded documents, you must define the index in the root collection class. (davemitchell)

h2. Geo option for Array GPS location field

Objective: When setting a geo GPS location array, the setter should try to convert the value to an array of floats

The "old" manual way:

<pre>
  class Person
    field :locations, :type => Array

    def locations= args
      @locations = args.kind_of?(String) ? args.split(",").map(&:to_f) : args
    end
  end
</pre>

*mongoid-geo* provides a new @:geo@ option that can be used with any Array field:

Usage example:

<pre>
  class Person
    field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true

    geo_index :location
  end

   p = Person.new

   # A Geo array can now be set via String or Strings, Hash or Object, here a few examples...
   # Please see geo_fields_spec.rb for more options!

   p.location = "45.1, -3.4"
   p.location = "45.1", "-3.4"
   p.location = {:lat => 45.1, :lng => -3.4}
   p.location = [{:lat => 45.1, :lng => -3.4}]
   p.location = {:latitude => 45.1, :longitude => -3.4}

   my_location  = Location.new :latitude => 45.1, :longitude => -3.4
   p.location   = my_location

   # for each of the above, the following holds
   assert([45.1, -3.4], p.location)

   # also by default adds #lat and #lng convenience methods (thanks to TeuF)

   assert(45.1 , p.lat)
   assert(-3.4 , p.lng)

   # the #lat and #lng convenience methods can also be customized with the :lat and :lng options
  field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true, :lat => :latitude, :lng => :longitude

  assert(45.1 , p.latitude)
  assert(-3.4 , p.longitude)

  # or set the array attributes using symmetric setter convenience methods!
  p.latitude   = 44
  assert(44 , p.latitude)

  # You can also reverse the lat/lng positioning of the array storage - this is fx useful for spherical calculations
  
  Mongoid::Geo.spherical_mode do
    # Mongoid::Geo.lat_index.should == 1
    # Mongoid::Geo.lng_index.should == 0
    address.location = "23.5, -47"
    address.location.should == [23.5, -47].reverse
  end  

  # or alternatively 
  Mongoid::Geo.spherical = true
  
  address.location = "23.5, -47"
  address.location.should == [23.5, -47].reverse  
</pre>

h3. Future ideas...

I have recently created a new geo *geo_calc* which includes the concept of a GeoPoint that is much more powerful than the current #to_point implementation in this gem.
I plan to substitute this functionality accordingly. Also I plan to include support for Geo vectors (see my *geo_vectors* gem) that I'm currently implementing.
Stay tuned!

h2. geoNear

<pre>
class Address
  include Mongoid::Document
  extend Mongoid::Geo::Near

  field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true
  ...
end

# Find all addresses sorted nearest to a specific address loation
nearest_addresses = Address.geoNear(another_address, :location)

class Position
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :pos, :type => Array, :geo => true
  ...
end
</pre>

Find all positions sorted nearest to the address loation

@nearest_positions = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos)@

Perform distance locations in Speherical mode inside Mongo DB (default is :plane)

@nearest_positions = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos, :mode => :sphere)@

Other options supported are: @:num, :maxDistance, :distanceMultiplier, :query@

GeoNear returns each distance calculated in degrees. Use the :distanceMultiplier or :unit option to return in the unit of your choice (see unit.rb).

Set @:distanceMultiplier = 6371@ to get distance in KMs
Set @@:distanceMultiplier = @3963.19@ to get distance in Miles

You can also use the :unit option instead like this (supports :feet, :meters, :kms, :miles):

@results = Address.geoNear @center.location, :location, :unit => :feet, :dist_order => :desc@

The _geoNear_ query result is returned as a _Mongoid::Criteria_

@results.desc(:distance).map(&:distance)@

Note that the @:fromLocation@ field, stores the location the distance was last calculated as a Hash of the GPS location point it was calculated from:

@[23.5, -47].hash@ 

This hash can be retrieved (and used for comparison?) using the @fromHash@ field 

@from = results.first.fromHash@

You can also at any time get the GPS location point which the distance of any result instance was calculated from, using the @fromPoint field

@from = results.first.fromPoint@
</pre>

You can now explicitly set/configure the Mongo DB version used. This will affect whether built-in Mongo DB distance calculation will be used or using standalone Ruby Haversine algorithm. By default the Mongo DB version is set to 1.8 (as of May 9, 2011) . See _geo_near_ specs for more details/info on this.

@Mongoid::Geo.mongo_db_version = 1.7@

h2. Mongoid Geo extra inclusions

Find addresses near a point using spherical distance calculation

<pre>
  Address.near_sphere(:location => [ 72, -44 ])
</pre>

h2. Mongoid Geo extra inflections

h3. near_sphere

<pre>
  base.where(:location.near_sphere => [ 72, -44 ])
  # => :location => { "$nearSphere" : [ 72, -44 ] }
</pre>

h3. near_max

Find points near a given point within a maximum distance

<pre>
  base.where(:location.near_max => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $near: [50, 40] , $maxDistance: 3 }

  base.where(:location.near_max(:sphere) => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $nearSphere: [50, 40] , $maxDistanceSphere: 3 }

  base.where(:location.near_max(:sphere, :flat) => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $nearSphere: [50, 40] , $maxDistance: 3 }
</pre>

You can also use a Hash to define the nearMax

<pre>
  places.where(:location.near_max => {:point => [ 72, -44 ], :distance => 5})
</pre>

Or use an Object (which must have the methods @#point@ and @#distance@ that return the point and max distance from that point)

<pre>
  near_max_ = (Struct.new :point, :distance).new
  near_max.point = [50, 40]
  near_max.distance = [30,55]

  places.where(:location.near_max => near_max)
</pre>

Note: For the points, you can also use a hash or an object with the methods/keys, either @:lat, :lng@ or @:latitude, :longitude@

Example:

<pre>
  center = (Struct.new :lat, :lng).new
  center.lat = 72
  center.lng = -44
  places.where(:location.within_center => [center, radius])

  # OR

  places.where(:location.within_center => [{:lat => 72, :lng => -44}, radius])
</pre>

h3. within_box

<pre>
  box = [[50, 40], [30,55]]
  base.where(:location.within_box => box)
  # => locations: {"$within" : {"$box" : [[50, 40], [30,55]]}

  base.where(:location.within_box(:sphere) => box)
  # => locations: {"$within" : {"$boxSphere" : [[50, 40], [30,55]]}
</pre>

You can also use a Hash to define the box

<pre>
  places.where(:location.within_box => {:lower_left => [50, 40], :upper_right => [30,55]})

  # or mix and match

  places.where(:location.within_box => {:lower_left => {:lat => 50, :lng => 40}, :upper_right => [30,55] } )
</pre>

Or use an object (which must have the methods @#lower_left@ and @#upper_right@ that return the points of the bounding box)

<pre>
  box = (Struct.new :lower_left, :upper_right).new
  box.lower_left =  [50, 40]
  box.upper_right = [30, 55]

  places.where(:location.within_box => box)
</pre>

h3. within_center

<pre>
  center = [50, 40]
  radius = 4

  places.where(:location.within_center => [center, radius])
  # => places: {"$within" : {"$center" : [[50, 40], 4]}

  places.where(:location.within_center(:sphere) => [center, radius])
  # => places: {"$within" : {"$centerSphere" : [[50, 40], 4]}
</pre>

You can also use a hash to define the circle, with @:center@ and @:radius@ keys

<pre>
  places.where(:location.within_center => {:center => [50, 40], :radius => 4})
</pre>
                                              
Or use an object (which must have the methods #center and #radius that return the center and radius of the circle))

<pre>
  circle = (Struct.new :center, :radius).new
  circle.center = [50, 40]
  circle.radius = 4

  places.where(:location.within_center => circle)
</pre>
               
h2. Note on the specs

The specs still use the old "Javascript" like method convention, such as _#nearSphere_ 
Don't let that fool you ;)

h2. Contribute

*Please feel free to contribute to the project!*

I aim to deliver a complete *geo* package for use with _Mongoid_. This gem should work nicely with _geo_calc_ and _geo_vectors_ that I'm also working on.
Please help me with these gems also and help make sure they all play nice and work together!

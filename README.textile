h1. Mongoid geo

A Geo extension for Mongoid.

"MongoDB Geospatial Indexing":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing

* Supports Mongoid 1.7 sphere distance calculations and
* Adds nearSphere inclusion method
* Adds a set of geo related inflections
* Adds an exta option for defining a "geo" field, to have the generated attr_writer parse and convert strings etc. to float arrays.

h2. Mongoid 2 geo features

h3. Find addresses near a point

<pre>
  Address.near(:latlng => [37.761523, -122.423575, 1])
</pre>

h3. Find locations within a circle

<pre>
  base.where(:location.within => { "$center" => [ [ 50, -40 ], 1 ] })
</pre>

h3. Create geo-spatial index

<pre>
  class Person
    field :location, :type => Array
    index [[ :location, Mongo::GEO2D ]], :min => -180, :max => 180
  end

  # to ensure indexes are created, either:
  Mongoid.autocreate_indexes = true

  # or in the mongoid.yml
  autocreate_indexes: true
</pre>

These are the only geo features I could find are currently built-in for Mongoid 2.
_Mongoid Geo_ implements the following extra features...

h1. Mongoid Geo features

The following briefly demonstrates all the features that Mongoid Geo currently provides

h2. Geo index

Old/Manual way: @index [[ :location, Mongo::GEO2D ]], :min => -180, :max => 180@

Using new _geo_index_ class method : @geo_index :location@

h2. Special geo-array attribute writer

When setting a geo-location array, the setter should try to convert the value to an array of floats

Old/Manual way:

<pre>
  class Person
    field :locations, :type => Array

    def locations= args
      @locations = args.kind_of?(String) ? args.split(",").map(&:to_f) : args
    end
  end
</pre>

With the new @:geo@ option supplied by _mongoid-geo_ :

<pre>
  class Person
    field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true

    geo_index :location
  end

   p = Person.new

   # A Geo array can now be set via String or Strings, Hash or Object, here a few examples...
   # Please see geo_fields_spec.rb for more options!

   p.location = "45.1, -3.4"
   p.location = "45.1", "-3.4"
   p.location = {:lat => 45.1, :lng => -3.4}
   p.location = [{:lat => 45.1, :lng => -3.4}]
   p.location = {:latitude => 45.1, :longitude => -3.4}

   my_location  = Location.new :latitude => 45.1, :longitude => -3.4
   p.location   = my_location

   # for each of the above, the following holds
   assert([45.1, -3.4], p.location)

   # also by default adds #lat and #lng convenience methods (thanks to TeuF)

   assert(45.1 , p.lat)
   assert(-3.4 , p.lng)

   # the #lat and #lng convenience methods can also be customized with the :lat and :lng options
  field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true, :lat => :latitude, :lng => :longitude

  assert(45.1 , p.latitude)
  assert(-3.4 , p.longitude)

  # or set the array attributes using symmetric setter convenience methods!
  p.latitude   = 44
  assert(44 , p.latitude)

  # PURE MAGIC!!!
</pre>

h2. News update (March 2)

* Added support for geoNear queries!!!

<pre>
class Address
  include Mongoid::Document
  extend Mongoid::Geo::Near

  field :location, :type => Array, :geo => true
  ...
end

# Find all addresses sorted nearest to a specific address loation
nearest_addresses = Address.geoNear(another_address, :location)

class Position
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :pos, :type => Array, :geo => true
  ...
end

# Find all positions sorted nearest to the address loation
nearest_positions = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos)

# perform distance locations in Speherical mode inside Mongo DB (default is :plane)
nearest_positions = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos, :mode => :sphere)

# other options supported are: :num, :maxDistance, distanceMultiplier, :query

# GeoNear distance returns distance in degrees. Use distanceMultiplier to return in Miles or KM.
# set distanceMultiplier to 6371 to get distance in KM
# set distanceMultiplier to 3963.19 to get distance in Miles
</pre>

If you need to operate on the Mongoid models referenced by the query result, simply call #to_models on it
Fx to get the city of the first model instance from the query result:

@nearest_city = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos).to_models.first.city@

You can also use a #to_model method on an individual query result like this:

@nearest_city = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos).first.to_model.city@

# the model returned also has a distance accessor populated with the distance calculated by running the geoNear query

@nearest_distance = Position.geoNear(another_address.location, :pos).first.to_model.distance@

You can now explicitly set/configure the Mongo DB version used. This will affect whether built-in Mongo DB distance calculation will be used or using standalone Ruby Haversine algorithm. By default the version is set to 1.5. See _geo_near_ specs for more details/info on this.

@Mongoid::Geo.mongo_db_version = 1.7@

h2. Mongoid Geo extra inclusions

Find addresses near a point using spherical distance calculation

<pre>
  Address.nearSphere(:location => [ 72, -44 ])
</pre>


h2. Mongoid Geo extra inflections

h3. nearSphere

<pre>
  base.where(:location.nearSphere => [ 72, -44 ])
  # => :location => { "$nearSphere" : [ 72, -44 ] }
</pre>

h3. nearMax

Find points near a given point within a maximum distance

<pre>
  base.where(:location.nearMax => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $near: [50, 40] , $maxDistance: 3 }

  base.where(:location.nearMax(:sphere) => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $nearSphere: [50, 40] , $maxDistanceSphere: 3 }

  base.where(:location.nearMax(:sphere, :flat) => [[ 72, -44 ], 5])
  # => { $nearSphere: [50, 40] , $maxDistance: 3 }
</pre>

You can also use a Hash to define the nearMax

<pre>
  places.where(:location.nearMax => {:point => [ 72, -44 ], :distance => 5})
</pre>

Or use an Object (which must have the methods @#point@ and @#distance@ that return the point and max distance from that point)

<pre>
  near_max_ = (Struct.new :point, :distance).new
  near_max.point = [50, 40]
  near_max.distance = [30,55]

  places.where(:location.nearMax => near_max)
</pre>

Note: For the points, you can also use a hash or an object with the methods/keys, either @:lat, :lng@ or @:latitude, :longitude@

Example:

<pre>
  center = (Struct.new :lat, :lng).new
  center.lat = 72
  center.lng = -44
  places.where(:location.withinCenter => [center, radius])

  # OR

  places.where(:location.withinCenter => [{:lat => 72, :lng => -44}, radius])
</pre>

h3. withinBox

<pre>
  box = [[50, 40], [30,55]]
  base.where(:location.withinBox => box)
  # => locations: {"$within" : {"$box" : [[50, 40], [30,55]]}

  base.where(:location.withinBox(:sphere) => box)
  # => locations: {"$within" : {"$boxSphere" : [[50, 40], [30,55]]}
</pre>

You can also use a Hash to define the box

<pre>
  places.where(:location.withinBox => {:lower_left => [50, 40], :upper_right => [30,55]})

  # or mix and match

  places.where(:location.withinBox => {:lower_left => {:lat => 50, :lng => 40}, :upper_right => [30,55] } )
</pre>

Or use an object (which must have the methods @#lower_left@ and @#upper_right@ that return the points of the bounding box)

<pre>
  box = (Struct.new :lower_left, :upper_right).new
  box.lower_left =  [50, 40]
  box.upper_right = [30, 55]

  places.where(:location.withinBox => box)
</pre>

h3. withinCenter

<pre>
  center = [50, 40]
  radius = 4

  places.where(:location.withinCenter => [center, radius])
  # => places: {"$within" : {"$center" : [[50, 40], 4]}

  places.where(:location.withinCenter(:sphere) => [center, radius])
  # => places: {"$within" : {"$centerSphere" : [[50, 40], 4]}
</pre>

You can also use a hash to define the circle, with @:center@ and @:radius@ keys

<pre>
  places.where(:location.withinCenter => {:center => [50, 40], :radius => 4})
</pre>

Or use an object (which must have the methods #lower_left and #upper_right that return the points of the bounding box)

<pre>
  circle = (Struct.new :center, :radius).new
  circle.center = [50, 40]
  circle.radius = 4

  places.where(:location.withinCenter => circle)
</pre>
